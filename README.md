# medium-insert
A media insert extension for the medium editor without external dependencies

##notes
This project is brand new, is not fully functional and still a little niave. The purpose of this project is to create a robust insert extension similar to the one that is available at medium.com - without any additional dependencies. Support for legacy browsers is not a concern with the project at the moment.
